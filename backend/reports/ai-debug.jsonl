Focus on asking only the minimum set of high-leverage questions, then stop once the intent is sufficiently clear.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 0: Decide Whether to Trigger\n- Trigger when the prompt is too short, vague, contradictory, or missing key details needed to proceed.\n- Do not trigger if the user’s intent is already clear enough to deliver a reasonable first response.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Missing Criticals\nIdentify the smallest set of missing information that blocks progress. Common categories:\n- Objective: What outcome they want.\n- Scope: What exactly is included/excluded.\n- Constraints: Time, budget, format, platform, brand, etc.\n- Preferences: Style, priority, trade-offs.\n- Required vs optional: Confirm what must be satisfied versus nice-to-have.\n\n### Step 2: Emit a JSON Clarification Chain (Fixed Schema)\nAlways output a JSON object that contains a short multi-question chain. Start the response with the marker `<!-- Clarification chain -->` on the first line, then output only the JSON (no extra text).\n- One single-choice question with options [\"是\", \"否\", \"其他\"].\n- One ranking question for priorities or preferences.\n- One free-text question for missing details.\n\nUse this schema (do not add extra top-level keys):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"clarify_chain\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"single_choice\",\n      \"question\": \"...\",\n      \"choices\": [\"是\", \"否\", \"其他\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ranking\",\n      \"question\": \"...\",\n      \"options\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"free_text\",\n      \"question\": \"补充说明\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Iterate with User Answers\n- When the user answers, refine the chain to the next smallest missing set.\n- Stop the chain once the request is “sufficiently clear” to proceed.\n- Keep each chain concise (max 3 questions per turn).\n\n## Question Design Rules\n\n- Use concrete options in ranking (not abstract labels), e.g., “越野性能 / 乘坐舒适 / 油耗 / 价格”.\n- Single-choice question should verify “必填 vs 选填” or a binary constraint, with “其他” as escape hatch.\n- Free-text question should be short and tightly scoped to the most critical missing detail.\n- Avoid asking for everything at once; keep the chain minimal.\n\n## Example Triggers\n\nUse these as examples of “low-quality prompts” that should trigger the chain:\n- “我想选越野车”\n- “帮我写个东西”\n- “做个页面”\n- “优化一下”\n- “这个怎么弄”\n\n## Example Output\n\nUser prompt: “我想选越野车”\n\n```json\n{\n  \"clarify_chain\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"single_choice\",\n      \"question\": \"预算是硬性约束吗？\",\n      \"choices\": [\"是\", \"否\", \"其他\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"ranking\",\n      \"question\": \"请按重要性排序：\",\n      \"options\": [\"越野性能\", \"乘坐舒适\", \"油耗\", \"价格\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"free_text\",\n      \"question\": \"补充说明（例如预算区间、使用场景、品牌偏好）\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStop asking once the user provides enough detail to recommend concrete options."}], "chat_messages": [{"id": "128f5858-9002-4833-bd77-cd474ce19ddf", "role": "user", "content": "hello", "skill_id": null, "created_at": "2026-01-17T16:18:04.742813"}], "created_at": "2026-01-17T16:18:04.747935+00:00"}

自下而上（Bottom-up，最推荐）\n从“可触达的客户数量 × 单位价值 × 购买频次”推出来，更可落地。\n\n#### 1）按客户数推（B2C/B2B都适用）\n- **TAM = 潜在客户总数 × 年ARPA（每客户年收入）**\n- **SAM = 可触达客户数 × 年ARPA**\n- **SOM = 预计可拿下客户数 × 年ARPA**\n\n其中：\n- 年ARPA = 客单价

产品匹配率…**\n\n### SOM（你能拿到的盘子）\n用“份额法”或“漏斗法”都行：\n\n**份额法（简单）**\n- SOM = SAM × 目标市占率（1-3年）\n- 市占率依据：竞品数量、渠道强弱、预算、差异化、产能\n\n**漏斗法（更可信）**\n- SOM客户数 = 线索量 × 转化率（从曝光→线索→商机→成交）  \n- SOM收入 = SOM客户数 × 年ARPA

**TAM**  \n2. 按你的可服务边界扣减（地区、客群、价格带、品类、渠道、合规等）得到 **SAM**  \n3. 按可获得份额（竞争格局、渠道能力、预算、销售周期）估算可拿到的比例得到 **SOM**\n\n**公式示例**\n- TAM = 行业总规模（元/年）\n- SAM = TAM × 覆盖比例（地区×客群×品类×渠道…）\n- SOM = SAM × 可获得份额（预计市占率或可成交比例）\n\n**优点**：快、适合融资PPT  \n**缺点**：容易“拍脑袋”，需要清晰说明扣减依据\n\n---\n\n### B. 自下而上（Bottom-up，最推荐）\n从“可触达的客户数量 × 单位价值 × 购买频次”推出来，更可落地。\n\n#### 1）按客户数推（B2C/B2B都适用）\n- **TAM = 潜在客户总数 × 年ARPA（每客户年收入）**\n- **SAM = 可触达客户数 × 年ARPA**\n- **SOM = 预计可拿下客户数 × 年ARPA**\n\n其中：\n- 年ARPA = 客单价 × 年购买次数（或订阅单价×12）\n\n**客户数怎么来**\n- 人口/企业总数（公开数据）  \n- 目标人群渗透率（满足需求的人占比）  \n- 付费意愿/可支付能力比例  \n\n> 常用拆法：  \n> 目标客户数 = 总基数 × 目标人群占比 × 需求发生率 × 可支付比例 × 可触达比例\n\n#### 2）按交易量推（电商/本地生活/交易平台常用）\n- TAM = 交易笔数 × 平均客单价（或GMV）\n- 若你赚佣金：收入TAM = GMV × 抽佣率（take rate）\n\n---\n\n## 3）把“TAM→SAM→SOM”算清楚的通用拆解框架\n\n### TAM（需求存在的总盘子）\n**TAM = 总基数 × 需求发生率 × 年均花费**\n- 总基数：全体人/全体企业/全体门店\n- 需求发生率：一年内会发生该需求的比例\n- 年均花费：平均一年在该类解决方案上的支出\n\n### SAM（你能服务到的盘子）\n在TAM基础上乘上“可服务边界”的过滤条件：\n- 地域（你覆盖的城市/国家）\n- 客群（你只做中小企业/只做宝妈等）\n- 产品形态（你只做SaaS/只做上门）\n- 渠道（你只通过抖音/线下代理）\n- 合规/供给（你能交付的范围）\n\n**SAM = TAM × 地域覆盖 × 客群覆盖 × 渠道覆盖 × 产品匹配率…**\n\n### SOM（你能拿到的盘子）\n用“份额法”或“漏斗法”都行：\n\n**份额法（简单）**\n- SOM = SAM × 目标市占率（1-3年）\n- 市占率依据：竞品数量、渠道强弱、预算、差异化、产能\n\n**漏斗法（更可信）**\n- SOM客户数 = 线索量 × 转化率（从曝光→线索→商机→成交）  \n- SOM收入 = SOM客户数 × 年ARPA  \n- 线索量可以由：销售人数×人均有效触达×有效线索率 推导\n\n---\n\n## 4）常见口径坑（避免被质疑）\n1. **别把“用户数”当市场规模**：要转成金额（收入或GMV）。  \n2. **明确时间单位**：年规模还是月规模。  \n3. **价格口径一致**：含税/不含税、人民币/美元、出厂价/零售价。  \n4. **SOM不要拍脑袋**：最好用“渠道/产能/销售漏斗”约束。  \n5. **TAM不等于你能做多大**：TAM可以大，SAM/SOM要合理收敛。\n\n---\n\n##

TAM 测算方法（建议用“渗透率×可穿戴人群”或“替代/补充可穿戴”逻辑）\n### 方法 A1：可穿戴用户基数 × 智能戒指渗透率 × ASP\n**公式（按年度 t）：**\n- TAM销量(t) = 可穿戴潜在人群(t) × 智能戒指渗透率(t)\n- TAM收入(t) = TAM销量(t) × 智能戒指 ASP(t)  \n（可再加：订阅渗透率 × ARPU）\n\n**关键参数怎么取：**\n1) **可穿戴潜在人群**：可用“智能手表/手环存量用户”或“健康管理兴趣人群”近似。  \n   - 数据来源建议：IDC/Canalys/Counterpoint（中国可穿戴出货/存量趋势）、QuestMobile（健康类 App 人群）、电商平台人群画像等。\n2) **渗透率**：智能戒指对可穿戴人群的渗透，一般早期低、随品类教育提升。  \n   - 可以用：海外成熟市场（如 Oura 等）曲线作参照，再按中国价格/渠道/生态差异打折。\n3) **ASP**：按中国 B2C 价位带加权平均（入门/主流/高端）。\n\n**优点**：适合做“品类天花板”；  \n**风险**：渗透率假设对结果敏感，需要和 A2/B1 校验。\n\n---\n\n### 方法 A2：需求场景人群法（睡眠/压力/健康管理）× 购买率 × ASP\n**公式：**\n- TAM销量(t) = 目标需求人群规模(t) × 年购买率(t)\n- TAM收入(t) = TAM销量(t) × ASP(t)\n\n**目标需求人群可选定义：**\n- 睡眠困扰人群、体重管理人群、慢病/亚健康关注人群、运动人群（跑步/骑行/健身）等。  \n**购买率**：由“可穿戴购买率×戒指替代/补充系数”推导。\n\n**优点**：适用于把智能戒指定位为“睡眠/恢复/健康管理设备”；  \n**风险**：需求人群口径可能偏宽，需要 SAM 收敛。\n\n---\n\n# B. SAM 测算方法（把 TAM 收敛到“你能服务到的那部分”）\nSAM 需要明确：**价位带、渠道覆盖、产品功能匹配、城市线级、用户画像**。\n\n### 方法 B1：价位带 × 渠道可达 × 人群匹配\n**公式：**\n- SAM销量(t) = TAM销量(t) × 价位带覆盖系数 × 渠道可达系数 × 场景匹配系数\n- SAM收入(t) = SAM销量(t) × ASP(你覆盖的价位带)\n\n**举例：**\n- 你只做 799–1299 元主流价位：则用该价位带对总销量的占比作为“价位带覆盖系数”\n- 你主要做电商：线下/运营商渠道覆盖不足则再乘一个“渠道可达系数”\n- 你主打睡眠恢复：对“运动/睡眠导向用户”保留较高，对“仅支付/NFC”场景降低\n\n---\n\n# C. SOM 测算方法（竞争与执行能力下可拿到的份额）\n### 方法 C1：份额法（最常用，适合融资/战略）\n- SOM收入(t) = SAM收入(t) × 目标市占率(t)\n- SOM销量(t) = SAM销量(t) × 目标市占率(t)\n\n**市占率怎么设更可信：**\n- 以“渠道份额×转化率×复购/留存”拆分，或用对标品牌在同类新品类进入早期的爬坡曲线。\n- 约束条件：产能/库存周转、营销预算、达人/投放效率、线下铺货能力、口碑与退货率等。\n\n### 方法 C2：自下而上销量法（更可执行，适合经营计划）\n- SOM销量(t) = Σ（渠道 i 的访客/曝光 × 转化率 × 客单价/ASP 的销量换算）\n- 或：SOM销量(t) = Σ（经销/门店数 × 单店月销 × 12）\n\n**建议做法**：C1 用于对外叙事，C2 用于内部经营校验。\n\n---\n\n## 四、未来3年预测的“最小假设集”（你只要填数即可跑模型）\n建议每年输入以下参数（表格化）：\n\n1) **宏观/品类**\n- 可穿戴设备出货或存量增长率\n- 智能戒指渗透率（对可穿戴人群）\n- 品类认知提升系数（影响渗透率或购买率）\n\n2) **价格与结构**\n- ASP（按价位带：入门/主流/高端）\n- 各价位带销量占比（结构升级/下沉）\n\n3) **渠道**\n- 电商/抖音/线下占比\n- 渠道可达系数（你能覆盖的渠道权重）\n\n4) **竞争与供给**\n- 头部品牌数量变化、价格战强度（影响 ASP）\n- 供应链良率、交付能力（影响 SOM 上限）\n\n---\n\n## 五、建议的最终输出结构（报告目录模板）\n你可以按以下结构直接输出 PPT/Word：\n\n### 1. 结论摘要（1页）\n- 未来3年中国 B2C 智能戒指：TAM/SAM/SOM（销量+收入）区间\n- 增长驱动（睡眠健康、无感佩戴、算法订阅、生态联动）\n- 主要风险（教育成本、测量准确性争议、退货率、戒围适配/售后）\n\n### 2. 市场定义与统计口径（1–2页）\n- 产品边界、渠道边界、收入口径（硬件/订阅）\n- 与智能手表/手环的关系：替代 vs 补充\n\n### 3. 需求与用户画像（2–3页）\n- 核心场景：睡眠/恢复、压力、体温趋势、女性健康、运动恢复、NFC\n- 人群：一二线白领、运动人群、睡眠困扰人群、健康管理人群\n- 购买决策因素：准确性、舒适度、续航、外观、生态、隐私\n\n### 4. 市场规模测算（核心章节，3–6页）\n#### 4.1 TAM（方法A1/A2）\n- 关键假设表（渗透率、基数、ASP）\n- 结果：未来3年 TAM（销量/收入）及敏感性分析（渗透率、ASP）\n\n#### 4.2 SAM（方法B1）\n- 你所覆盖的价位带/渠道/场景系数\n- 结果：未来3年 SAM（销量/收入）\n\n#### 4.3 SOM（方法C1 + C2校验）\n- 市占率路径（保守/基准/激进）\n- 渠道拆解的自下而上校验（电商/抖音/线下）\n- 结果：未来3年 SOM（销量/收入）\n\n### 5. 竞争格局与对标（2–4页）\n- 国内外主要玩家：产品力、价位、卖点、渠道、订阅策略\n- 差异化机会：算法能力、无感佩戴、女性健康、生态绑定、BOM/成本\n\n### 6. 增长驱动与风险（1–2页）\n- 驱动：品类教育、测量指标扩展、AI 健康建议、订阅商业化、生态联动\n- 风险：法规合规（医疗宣称）、数据合规、口碑/退货、戒围适配、供应链\n\n### 7. 附录：参数表与数据来源清单（1–2页）\n- 所有假设数值、来源、计算表格链接（便于复核）\n\n---\n\n## 六、交付物建议（你可以直接让团队照着做）\n- 1) **Excel 模型**：输入假设 → 自动输出 TAM/SAM/SOM（销量+收入）+ 敏感性（渗透率/ASP/市占率）\n- 2) **PPT 10–15 页**：按上面目录\n- 3) **数据来源表**：IDC/Canalys/Counterpoint/QuestMobile/电商平台类目销量抓取/品牌财报与公开采访等\n\n---\n\n如果你希望我把这套方法“跑出一版带数字的未来3年区间（保守/基准/激进）”，我可以直接给你一份可引用的测算表；你只需要告诉我：你计划主打的**价位带（如 599–999 / 999–1999）**、主要渠道（电商/抖音/线下占比）、以及是否包含**订阅收入**。", "skill_id": null, "created_at": "2026-01-17T21:38:45.947773"}, {"id": "4e991472-8719-43ec-b65c-520a929a61bc", "role": "user", "content": "开始", "skill_id": "7935b50e-b6a1-436b-bda4-9f7f91ccf448", "created_at": "2026-01-17T21:46:23.974978"}], "created_at": "2026-01-17T21:46:23.982153+00:00"}
